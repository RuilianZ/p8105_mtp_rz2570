## Problem 1 - Data

``` r
horn_df = read_excel("data/p8105_mtp_data.xlsx", range = "A9:I1230") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate_at("eop_size_mm", ~replace(., is.na(.), 0)) %>% 
  mutate(sex = factor(sex),
         age_group = factor(age_group),
         eop_size = factor(eop_size),
         eop_visibility_classification = factor(eop_visibility_classification),
         eop_shape = factor(eop_shape),
         fhp_category = factor(fhp_category)
         )

horn_df %>% 
  group_by(sex, age_group) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = age_group,
              values_from = n) %>% 
  mutate(sex = recode(sex, '0' = "Female", '1' = "Male")) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'sex'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.

| sex    |   1 |   2 |   3 |   4 |   5 |   6 |   7 |   8 |
|:-------|----:|----:|----:|----:|----:|----:|----:|----:|
| Female |   1 | 151 | 102 | 106 |  99 |  89 |  65 |   1 |
| Male   |   1 | 152 | 102 | 101 | 101 |  89 |  61 |  NA |

-   Fill the missing value in `eop_size_mm` with `0`, factorize
    categorical variables.  
-   9 related variables from 1221 participants form the data.
    Information includes sex, age, size, visibility and shape of EOP,
    size and category of FHP. There are numeric and categorical
    variables respectively depicting EOP and FHP.  
-   The distribution of age is generally the same across sex.

``` r
a = horn_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = eop_size)) +
  geom_bar()

b = horn_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = eop_visibility_classification)) +
  geom_bar()

c = horn_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = eop_shape)) +
  geom_bar()

d = horn_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fhp_category)) +
  geom_bar()

ggarrange(a, b, c, d)
```

-   The `14.6` in `eop_size` and `30.8` in `fhp_category` do not
    correctly implement the definition based on underlying continuous
    variable `eop_size_mm` and `fhp_size_mm`.  
-   `eop_visibility_classification` correctly implement the definition
    based on underlying continuous variable `eop_size_mm`.  
-   There are some missing values in `eop_shape` which need to be
    addressed.  
-   Further analysis will filter out age group 1 since one of the member
    is misclassified by age and the other one aged 17, and the study is
    looking at age 18+.  
-   The abnormal values are listed as below:

``` r
horn_df %>% 
  filter(age_group == "1") %>% 
  select(sex, age, age_group) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| sex | age | age\_group |
|:----|----:|:-----------|
| 0   |  17 | 1          |
| 1   |  45 | 1          |

``` r
horn_df %>% 
  filter(eop_size == "14.6") %>%
  select(sex, age, eop_size_mm, eop_size) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| sex | age | eop\_size\_mm | eop\_size |
|:----|----:|--------------:|:----------|
| 1   |  62 |            15 | 14.6      |

``` r
horn_df %>% 
  filter(fhp_category == "30.8") %>% 
  select(sex, age, fhp_size_mm, fhp_category) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| sex | age | fhp\_size\_mm | fhp\_category |
|:----|----:|--------------:|:--------------|
| 0   |  51 |          30.3 | 30.8          |

## Problem 2 - Visualization

``` r
fhp_plot = horn_df %>% 
  filter(!(age_group == 1)) %>% 
  mutate(age_group = recode(age_group, `2` = "18-29", `3` = "30's", `4` = "40's", `5` = "50's", `6` = "60+", `7` = "60+", `8` = "60+")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age_group, y = fhp_size_mm, fill = sex)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Age group (years)",
       y = "Forward Head Protraction Size (mm)") +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Sex", labels = c("Female", "Male")) +
  labs(subtitle = "A")

eop_plot = horn_df %>% 
  filter(!(age_group == 1),
         !(eop_size == 14.6)) %>%
  mutate(
    age_group = recode(age_group, `2` = "18-29", `3` = "30's", `4` = "40's", `5` = "50's", `6` = "60+", `7` = "60+", `8` = "60+"),
    eop_enlarged = ifelse(eop_size %in% c(0, 1), "non_enlarged", "enlarged")) %>% 
  group_by(sex, age_group, eop_enlarged) %>% 
  summarize(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = eop_enlarged,
    values_from = n_obs) %>% 
  mutate(enlarged_ratio = enlarged / (enlarged + non_enlarged)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age_group, y = enlarged_ratio, group = sex, color = sex)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Age group (years)",
       y = "Ratio of enlarged EOP") +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Sex", labels = c("Female", "Male")) +
  labs(subtitle = "B")
```

-   The overall *FHP size* and *EEOP ratio* are generally larger within
    male than female. There is an increasing trend of FHP size when the
    age increases, and the highest FHP size is found in 60+ males. There
    is no clear age trend for EEOP ratio. People aged 18-29 has the
    highest ratio of EEOP, while people in their 40’s have the lowest
    ratio of EEOP.

``` r
horn_df %>% 
  filter(!(age_group == 1)) %>%
  mutate(
    sex = recode(sex, `0` = "Female", `1` = "Male"), 
    age_group = recode(age_group, `2` = "18-29", `3` = "30's", `4` = "40's", `5` = "50's", `6` = "60+", `7` = "60+", `8` = "60+")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = fhp_size_mm, y = eop_size_mm)) + 
  geom_point(color = "blue", size = 1, alpha = .8) +
  facet_grid(sex ~ age_group) +
  labs(subtitle = "C")
```

    ## Warning: Removed 6 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

![](p8105_mtp_rz2570_files/figure-gfm/association%20between%20FHP%20size%20and%20EOP%20size-1.png)<!-- -->

-   Participants aged 18-29 tend to have smaller FHP sizes, but the
    distribution of *EOP size* against *FHP size* is not significantly
    different across age and sex groups, and there is no clear
    association between EOP size and FHP size within each group.

## Problem 3 – Reproducing reported results

``` r

-   The authors’ stated sample sizes in each age group are inconsistent
    with the data available.  
-   The reported mean for FHP size is consistent with the data
    available, but standard deviations aren’t the same.  
    The authors find “the prevalence of EEOP to be 33% of the study
    population”. What is the definition of EEOP, and what variables can
    you use to evaluate this claim? Is the finding consistent with the
    data available to you?
-   *EOP* is *enlarged external occipital protuberance*. The claim can
    be cacluated by `eop size`. Prevalence calculated by this data is
    43%, which is different from 33%.  
-   FHP is more common in people over 60. Specific value calculated with
    data is 32.6%.

## Prblem 4

*Summarize your results, the quality of the data analysis / presentation
of results in the original report, and comment on the conclusions of the
reports’ authors. Do you think the data provide evidence that cell
phones are causing horn growth? What other data would you like to have
to address this hypothesis?*
