## Problem 1 - Data

``` r
horn_df = read_excel("data/p8105_mtp_data.xlsx", range = "A9:I1230") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate_at("eop_size_mm", ~replace(., is.na(.), 0)) %>% 
  mutate(sex = factor(sex),
         age_group = factor(age_group),
         eop_size = factor(eop_size),
         eop_visibility_classification = factor(eop_visibility_classification),
         eop_shape = factor(eop_shape),
         fhp_category = factor(fhp_category)
         )

horn_df %>% 
  group_by(sex, age_group) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = age_group,
              values_from = n) %>% 
  mutate(sex = recode(sex, '0' = "Female", '1' = "Male")) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'sex'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.

| sex    |   1 |   2 |   3 |   4 |   5 |   6 |   7 |   8 |
|:-------|----:|----:|----:|----:|----:|----:|----:|----:|
| Female |   1 | 151 | 102 | 106 |  99 |  89 |  65 |   1 |
| Male   |   1 | 152 | 102 | 101 | 101 |  89 |  61 |  NA |

-   Fill the missing value in `eop_size_mm` with `0`, factorize
    categorical variables.  
-   9 related variables from 1221 participants form the data.
    Information includes sex, age, size, visibility and shape of EOP,
    size and category of FHP. There are numeric and categorical
    variables respectively depicting EOP and FHP.  
-   The distribution of age is generally the same across sex.

``` r
a = horn_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = eop_size)) +
  geom_bar()

b = horn_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = eop_visibility_classification)) +
  geom_bar()

c = horn_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = eop_shape)) +
  geom_bar()

d = horn_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fhp_category)) +
  geom_bar()

ggarrange(a, b, c, d)
```

-   The `14.6` in `eop_size` and `30.8` in `fhp_category` do not
    correctly implement the definition based on underlying continuous
    variable `eop_size_mm` and `fhp_size_mm`. The rows of two erroneous
    value are respectively extracted as below.  
-   `eop_visibility_classification` correctly implement the definition
    based on underlying continuous variable `eop_size_mm`.  
-   There are some missing values in `eop_shape` which need to be
    addressed.

-   Filter out age group 1 since there are only two members in it, one
    of whom is misclassified by age, and the study is looking at age
    18+.  
-   The overall FHP size and ratio of having enlarged EPO are generally
    larger within male than female. There is an increasing trend of FHP
    size when the age increases, and the highest FHP size is found in
    people in their 70’s. Age group 2 (18-30 age) has the highest ratio
    of enlarged EOP, while people in age group 1, 4 and 8 are less
    likely to have enlarged EOP.

``` r
horn_df %>% 
  filter(!(age_group == 1)) %>%
  mutate(
    sex = recode(sex, `0` = "Female", `1` = "Male"), 
    age_group = recode(age_group, `2` = "18-29", `3` = "30's", `4` = "40's", `5` = "50's", `6` = "60+", `7` = "60+", `8` = "60+")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = fhp_size_mm, y = eop_size_mm)) + 
  geom_point(color = "blue", size = 1, alpha = .8) +
  facet_grid(sex ~ age_group) +
  labs(subtitle = "C")
```

    ## Warning: Removed 6 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

-   The distribution of eop size against fhp size is not significantly
    different across age and sex groups, and there is no clear
    association between eop size and fhp size within each group.

## Problem 3 – Reproducing reported results

-   The authors’ stated sample sizes in each age group are inconsistent
    with the data available.  
-   The reported mean for FHP size is consistent with the data
    available, but standard deviations aren’t the same.  
    The authors find “the prevalence of EEOP to be 33% of the study
    population”. What is the definition of EEOP, and what variables can
    you use to evaluate this claim? Is the finding consistent with the
    data available to you?
-   *EOP* is *enlarged external occipital protuberance*. The claim can
    be cacluated by `eop size`. Prevalence calculated by this data is
    43%, which is different from 33%.  
-   FHP is more common in people over 60. Specific value calculated with
    data is 32.6%.

## Prblem 4

*Summarize your results, the quality of the data analysis / presentation
of results in the original report, and comment on the conclusions of the
reports’ authors. Do you think the data provide evidence that cell
phones are causing horn growth? What other data would you like to have
to address this hypothesis?*
